Eventually, any interesting software project will come to depend on another project, library, or framework. Git provides submodules to help with this. Submodules allow you to include or embed one or more repositories as a sub-folder inside another repository.

For many projects, submodules aren’t the best answer (more on this below), and even at their best, working with submodules can be tricky, but let’s start by looking at a straight-forward example.

### Adding a Submodule

Let’s say you’re working on a project called Slingshot. You’ve got code for `y-shaped stick` and a `rubber-band`.

At the same time, in another repository, you’ve got another project called Rock—it’s just a generic `rock` library, but you think it’d be perfect for Slingshot.

You can add `rock` as a submodule of `slingshot`. In the `slingshot` repository:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/rock rock
```

At this point, you’ll have a `rock` folder inside `slingshot`, but if you were to peek inside that folder, depending on your version of Git, you might see … nothing.

Newer versions of Git will do this automatically, but older versions will require you to explicitly tell Git to download the contents of `rock`:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If everything looks good, you can commit this change and you’ll have a `rock` folder in the `slingshot` repository with all the content from the `rock` repository.

On GitHub, the `rock` folder icon will have a little indicator showing that it is a submodule:

And clicking on the `rock` folder will take you over to the `rock` repository.

That’s it! You’ve embedded the `rock` repository inside the `slingshot` repository. You can interact with all the content from `rock` as if it were a folder inside `slingshot` (because it is).

On the command-line, Git commands issued from `slingshot` (or any of the other folders, `rubber-band` and `y-shaped-stick`) will operate on the “parent repository”, `slingshot`, but commands you issue from the `rock` folder will operate on just the `rock` repository:

```bash
cd ~/projects/slingshot
git log # log shows commits from Project Slingshot
cd ~/projects/slingshot/rubber-band
git log # still commits from Project Slingshot
cd ~/projects/slingshot/rock
git log # commits from Rock
```

### Joining a project using submodules

Now, say you’re a new collaborator joining Project Slingshot. You’d start by running `git clone` to download the contents of the `slingshot` repository. At this point, if you were to peek inside the `rock` folder, you’d see … nothing.

Again, Git expects us to explicitly ask it to download the submodule’s content. You can use `git submodule update --init --recursive` here as well, but if you’re cloning `slingshot` for the first time, you can use a modified `clone` command to ensure you download everything, including any submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive <project url>
```

### Switching to submodules

It can be a little tricky to take an existing subfolder and turn it into an external dependency. Let’s look at an example.

You’re about to start a new project—a [magic roll-back can](http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/magic-rollback-can-sick-science/) –which *also* needs a `rubber-band`. Let’s take the `rubber-band` you built for `slingshot`, split it out into a stand-alone repository, and then embed it into both projects via submodules.

You can take everything from the Project Slingshot’s `rubber-band` folder and extract it into a new repository and even maintain the commit history.

Let’s begin by extracting the contents of the `rubber-band` folder out of `slingshot`. You can use `git filter-branch` to do this, leaving you with just the commits related to `rubber-band`. The `git filter-branch` command will rewrite our repository’s history, making it look as if the `rubber-band` folder had been it’s own repository all along. For more information on `git filter-branch`, see [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/).

The first step is to make a copy of `slingshot` to work on—the end-goal is for `rubber-band` to stand as its own repository, so leave `slingshot` as is. You can use `cp` with `-r` to recursively copy the entire `slingshot` folder to a new folder `rubber-band`.

```bash
cd ..
cp -r slingshot rubber-band
```

It looks like `rubber-band` is just another `slingshot`, but now, from the `rubber-band` repository, run `git filter-branch`:

```python
cd rubber-band
pwd # (double check before proceeding!)
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter rubber-band -- --all
```

At this point, you’ll have a folder `rubber-band`, which is a repository that sort of resembles Project Slingshot, but it *only* has the files and commit history from the `rubber-band` folder.

Since you copied this from `slingshot`, the new repository will still have any remote tracking branches you setup when it was `slingshot`. You don’t want to push `rubber-band` back onto `slingshot`. You want to push this to a new repository.

[Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) for `rubber-band` on GitHub, then update the remote for `rubber-band`. Assuming you were calling the remote `origin`, you could:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<user>/rubber-band
```

Then you can publish the new “generic rubber-band module” with `git push`.

Now that you’ve separated `rubber-band` into its own repository, you need to delete the old `rubber-band` folder from the `slingshot` repository:

```bash
git rm -r rubber-band
git commit -m "Remove rubber-band (preparing for submodule)"
```

Then update `slingshot` to use `rubber-band` as a submodule:

```sql
git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/rubber-band rubber-band
git commit -m "rubber-band submodule"
```

Like we saw before when we were adding `rock`, we now have a repository-in-a-repository. Three repositories, in fact: the “parent” repository `slingshot`, plus the two “sub” repositories, `rock` and `rubber-band`.

In addition, if we dive back into `slingshot` ‘s history, we’ll see the commits we originally made into `rubber-band` back when it was a folder—deleting the folder didn’t erase any of the history. This can sometimes be a little confusing—since the `rubber-band` “child” repository has a copied-and-modified version of those old `slingshot` commits, it can sometimes feel like you’re having déja vu.

Unfortunately, any collaborator who pulls `slingshot` at this point will have an empty `rubber-band` folder. You might want to remind your collaborators to run this command to ensure they have all the submodule’s content:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You’ll also want to add the `rubber-band` submodule to `magic roll-back can`. Luckily, all you need to do that is to follow the same procedure you used earlier when you added `rock` to `slingshot`, in “Adding a submodule.”

```sql
cd ~/projects/roll-back-can
git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/rubber-band rubber-band
git commit -m "rubber-band submodule"
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Advice on using submodules (or not)

- Before you add a repository as a submodule, first check to see if you have a better alternative available. Git submodules work well enough for simple cases, but these days there are often better tools available for managing dependencies than what Git submodules can offer. Modern languages like [Go](https://golang.org/) have friendly, Git-aware dependency management systems built-in from the start. Others, like Ruby’s [rubygems](http://guides.rubygems.org/), Node.js’ [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm), or Cocoa’s [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/about) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), have been added by the programming community. Even front-end developers have tools like [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage libraries and frameworks for client-side JavaScript and CSS.
- Remember that Git doesn’t download submodule contents by default. If you’re adding a submodule to an existing project, make sure anyone that works on the project knows they need to run commands like `git submodule update` and `git clone --recursive` to ensure they get everything—this includes any automated deployment or testing service that might be involved in the project! We recommend you use something like our [“Scripts to Rule Them All”](http://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/) to ensure that all collaborators and services have access to the same repository content everywhere.
- Submodules require you to carefully balance consistency and convenience. The setup used here strongly prefers consistency, at the cost of a little convenience. It’s generally best to have a project’s submodules locked to a specific SHA, so all collaborators receive the same content. But this setup also makes it difficult for developers in the “parent” repository to contribute changes back to the submodule repository.
- Remember that collaborators won’t automatically see updates to submodules—if you update a submodule, you may need to remind your colleagues to run `git submodule update` or they will likely see odd behavior.
- Managing dynamic, rapidly evolving or heavily co-dependent repositories with submodules can quickly become frustrating. This post was focused on simple, relatively static parent-child repository relationships. A future follow-up post will detail some strategies to help manage more complex submodule workflows.
